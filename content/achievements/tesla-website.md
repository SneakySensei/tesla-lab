We decided we needed an online presence to showcase our porjects, achievements, and our precious members that make all that possible. So we made this project in order to make all that possible. This project was made using **Next.js**. In order to keep the content updated we have set up a simple commit based CMS system where we add new content in markdown files and then we use **grey-matter** to parse that into website data.
